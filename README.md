 ## Design

### Colour Scheme

For the colours wanted the game to feel fun and relaxing so I choose warm, bright, complementary and contrasting colours.

## The logo

The logo was designed by my daughter Lara using photopea (https://www.photopea.com/) as she wanted to be involved.

### Typography

For the fonts, again I wanted something bubbly and fun so I chose Sedgwick Ave with a fallback of  sans-serif.
This is a font from googlefonts.

### Imagery

For this project on ly two images where used, the logo which was already metioned above and the background image. The background image is a frame capture of a video I was intending to use but I then changed my mind as it wasgoing to consume more resourses. The video is free too use and it is from (https://www.videvo.net)
I looked for an image that would fit the colous and the subject and I believe this image fits in perfectly.
