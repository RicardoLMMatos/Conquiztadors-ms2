## About

ConQuiztadors is a quiz game for my Code Institute Full-stack developer ms2 project.
The idea of making a quiz game to this project was bacause I wanted to created something  very interactive and that I personaly like which is quiz games.

I have tried to make this game bery interactive, the users will have the chance to choose between six subjects, each subject has ten randomised  questions.
On each answer the user will get a red or green light when clicking the chosen answer  (red for wrong and green for right answer) and the user will also get a message after pressing the button with right or wrong text.
At the end of each round the user will get the score and a personalised message for three types of score, less than five correct answers, between six and nine correct answers or ten out of ten correct answers.

 ## Design

### Colour Scheme

For the colours wanted the game to feel fun and relaxing so I choose warm, bright, complementary and contrasting colours.

## The logo

The logo was designed by my daughter Lara using photopea (https://www.photopea.com/) as she wanted to be involved.

Colours used for the logo:

### Typography

For the fonts, again I wanted something bubbly and fun so I chose Sedgwick Ave with a fallback of  sans-serif.
This is a font from googlefonts.

### Imagery

For this project on ly two images where used, the logo which was already metioned above and the background image. The background image is a frame capture of a video I was intending to use but I then changed my mind as it wasgoing to consume more resourses. The video is free too use and it is from (https://www.videvo.net)
I looked for an image that would fit the colous and the subject and I believe this image fits in perfectly.

Background image :

### Wireframes


I have used Balsamic wireframe software to create my initial wireframes, for desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile.
The finished product came very close to the initial concept.
